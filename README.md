# COS285 Lab 4 
This lab explores binary trees and recursion in Java.  implemented a custom `MyBinaryTree` class with recursive insertion, breadth-first search printing, and recursive search, also practiced using GitHub  and running Java programs with command-line arguments.

## Team Members
Grace

## Files Included
Cos285Lab4.java contains the `main` method to build and test the tree
MyBinaryTree.java implements the binary tree and required methods
data.txt input data used to build the tree

## Features Implemented
 Recursive insertion into a binary search tree
Breadth-first search traversal
 Recursive search method to find specific values
 Command-line argument support for reading input data

## How to Run (Command Line)
To run the program from the terminal:

```bash
javac Cos285Lab4.java MyBinaryTree.java
java Cos285Lab4 data.txt
